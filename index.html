    <h1> Get to Know Me! </h1> 
    <img src="https://ibb.co/cFHxL5">
    <p> I was born on April 16th, 2001. I am currently a Junior at Trinity High School, where I run Track and Field. The main events that I run are 4x200, 4x100, 200's, and sometimes a 400. Besides Track and Field I am an Ambassador where I wuould host a number of shadows, helping grade schoolers get through their shadow day in high school. Being ambassador has open me up to new opportunities in the Trinity community because of it was able to be a leader in many diifferent activities like hosting a ice cream social for incoming freshmen, being a grouping leader in a field day for 6th and 7th graders, and many more fun activities.   </p>
